Ah, 2015. Back when we were all binge watching Breaking Bad spinoffs, freaking out over Mad Max: Fury Road, and wondering how the Avengers franchise could get any bigger. Meanwhile, over at WWE, they were busy assembling a new batch of trainees at the Performance Center, their (all?) elite wrestling school that‚Äôs produced some of today‚Äôs biggest stars. Now, let‚Äôs take a look at where those 2015 hopefuls are in 2023. Spoiler alert: some made it big, some fizzled out, and others found success outside the WWE machine.

## üá¶üá∫ Australia Representing: The Iconic Duo

![Jessica McKay aka Billie Kay training with IIconics tag team partner, Cassie McIntosh aka Peyton Royce at the WWE Performance Center in 2015](./img/pc-peyton-billie.webp)
### Cassie McIntosh aka Peyton Royce aka Cassie Lee (Born in Sydney, resided in Melbourne, Australia)

We gotta start with Cassie McIntosh, who, along with Jessica McKay, formed The IIconics. If this were 2015, you‚Äôd find her in NXT honing her craft, but by 2018, she was tearing up the main roster. Released in 2021, she and McKay found themselves heading to Impact Wrestling under the name ‚ÄúThe IInspiration.‚Äù Cassie stepped away from the ring to focus on her family but recently hinted at a possible WWE return for the Royal Rumble. Because, let‚Äôs be honest, who doesn‚Äôt want a pop like Daniel Bryan‚Äôs in 2014? She is currently taking time away to care for her newborn with ~~AEW~~ WWE NXT superstar, Shawn Spears.  

Status: Inactive (but maybe not for long‚Ä¶)

**Update: May 17, 2024**   
Certainly! When interviewed by Ring The Belle, Cassie Lee (formerly known as Peyton Royce) expressed openness to potentially returning for the WWE Royal Rumble. She stated:  
> Yeah, I‚Äôm open to it, for sure. I would love that. It‚Äôd be so good to catch up. I mean, it‚Äôs the Royal Rumble. We said no last time because we were still pretty hurt about [getting released]. But I feel healed now, and I feel like I‚Äôd love to do that if the opportunity came.

### Jessica McKay aka Billie Kay (Sydney, Australia)

Jessica McKay took the same path as her bestie, Cassie. Training in Australia, jumping to NXT, and eventually becoming one-half of the WWE Women‚Äôs Tag Team Champions. Released the same day as Cassie, she made a brief stop in Impact Wrestling before turning her attention to acting and modeling. If you check her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jessicamckay/?hl=en), she‚Äôs living that post-wrestling life but still in the limelight.

## üá®üá¶ From Canada to WWE Stardom

### Nhooph Al-Areebi Aka Aliyah (Toronto, Ontario, Canada)

Remember when The Weeknd was dominating the charts in 2015? That‚Äôs when Nhooph Al-Areebi, known as Aliyah, was entering the WWE Performance Center. Her circus school background (yes, really) helped her become one of the more agile performers in NXT. After a long stint in developmental, Aliyah finally made it to the main roster in 2021. Unfortunately, injuries sidelined her, and in 2023, she was quietly released. Twitter may have moved on, but the Aliyah stans are still holding out hope.

Status: Inactive (released in 2023)

## üá©üá™ European TakeOver
![Axel Tischer aka Alexander Wolfe at the WWE Performance Center in 2015](./img/axel.webp)
### Axel Tischer Aka Alexander Wolfe (Dresden, Germany) 

Remember when SAnitY was a thing? Axel Tischer, known as Alexander Wolfe, was part of the chaotic faction that made waves in NXT before heading to the main roster. After SAnitY disbanded, Wolfe found success in NXT UK but was released in 2021. He‚Äôs now tearing up the indie scene across Europe. If you miss that hardcore European style, Wolfe‚Äôs your guy.

## üá≤üáΩ Mexico‚Äôs Lucha Libre Legacy
![Oscar Vasquez aka Magno at the WWE Performance Center in 2015](./img/oscar.webp)
### Oscar Vasquez Aka Magno (Ciudad Juarez, Mexico) 
Oscar Vasquez, better known in lucha circles as Magno, had all the hype when he joined the WWE Performance Center in 2015. His roots in Mexican wrestling showed potential, but he never quite broke out of the NXT bubble. After a quiet exit from WWE in 2016, he‚Äôs been doing the lucha libre circuit, but recent matches are sparse.

Status: Unknown (last match documented was from May 5, 2022 for Lucha VaVoom)

## üá∑üá∏ From Greco-Roman Wrestling to WWE: Serbia‚Äôs Hope
![Radomir Petkovic aka King Constantine at the WWE Performance Center in 2015](./img/radomir.webp)
### Radomir Petkovic Aka King Constantine from Belgrade, Serbia 

Every WWE class needs a wildcard, and for 2015, that was Radomir Petkovic. A Greco-Roman wrestling champion with legit Olympic-level talent, Petkovic looked poised to be a surefire success. But wrestling success didn‚Äôt come as easily as medals, and he was cut after a year. He‚Äôs since disappeared from the wrestling scene.

## üá¨üáß UK‚Äôs Rugby Star Turned Wrestler
![Peter Howard at the WWE Performance Center in 2015](./img/peterhoward.webp)
### Peter Howard (Exeter, England)

Peter Howard had a rugby player‚Äôs build and potential, but like an injury-prone NFL draft pick, his WWE career was over before it really began. A former discus champ, Howard didn‚Äôt catch on in WWE, leaving the company in 2016. Since then? No updates. Another ‚Äúwhat could have been‚Äù story in the WWE talent pipeline.

## üá∫üá∏ USA Representing: The Stars of the Class

![Kenneth Crawford aka Montez Ford at the WWE Performance Center in 2015](./img/kenneth.webp)
### Kenneth Crawford Aka Montez Ford (Chicago, Illinois/Anson County, North Carolina) 

While Empire was dominating TV, Kenneth Crawford, now known as Montez Ford, was on his way to becoming one-half of The Street Profits. In 2015, he was just getting his feet wet in WWE, but fast forward to today, and he‚Äôs a multi-time WWE Tag Team Champion and one of the most charismatic guys on the roster. If The Rock ever needs a prot√©g√©, Ford‚Äôs ready.

![Thomas Kingdon at the WWE Performance Center in 2015](./img/thomas.webp)
### Thomas Kingdon (Traverse City, Michigan)

Thomas Kingdon had the bodybuilder look Vince McMahon usually loves, but, as we know, muscle doesn‚Äôt always translate to wrestling stardom. Released in 2016, Kingdon has mostly stayed out of the wrestling spotlight since. Probably sipping protein shakes and reminiscing about the WWE days.

![Sesugh Uhaa aka Apollo Crews at the WWE Performance Center in 2015](./img/sesugh.webp)
### Sesugh Uhaa Aka Apollo Crews (Atlanta, Georgia)

Sesugh Uhaa, known in WWE as Apollo Crews, had all the tools when he arrived in 2015 ‚Äî insane athleticism, a background with Dragon Gate, and a whole lot of buzz. After a solid main roster run, he moved back to NXT in 2022, where he‚Äôs still kicking it today. When you can do a standing moonsault like Crews, there‚Äôs always a spot for you.

![Levis Valenzuela Jr. at the WWE Performance Center in 2015](./img/levis.webp)
### Levis Valenzuela Jr. (Durham, North Carolina) 

Levis trained with CWF Mid-Atlantic in 2013 and wrestled mostly for them until 2015 when he earned a spot on the 2015 WWE Performance Center class. He debuted as No Way Jose on NXT in 2016 and got called up to the main roster in 2018. He was eventually released from the WWE in 2020. He made a brief appearance with Impact! Wrestling and has been seen on a few independent shows.
